## Getting started
* Clone this repository
  * `git clone https://github.com/ptumb001/acm-basilisk.git`
* Navigate to cloned directory
  * `cd acm-basilisk`
* Install Node dependencies
  * Run `npm install`

You're ready to go! Run any task by typing `npm run task` (where "task" is the name of the task in the `"scripts"` object). The most useful task for rapid development is `watch`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!
